          <h3>Technique</h3>
          <p>
            The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by
            Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work
            into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by
            short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro", from the
            Italian word for 'tomato', inspired by the tomato-shaped kitchen
            timer Cirillo used as a university student.

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            The Pomodoro Technique is a productivity method that involves
            working in 25-minute focused bursts, known as "pomodoros", followed
            by 5-minute breaks. After four pomodoros, a longer break of 15-30
            minutes is recommended. This approach is designed to boost
            efficiency and maintain consistent attention, preventing burnout and
            managing distractions.

          <h3>Tips</h3>
          <p>
            Set Clear Goals: Before starting a pomodoro, know exactly what you
            plan to work on. Setting specific, achievable goals for each
            interval increases effectiveness. Minimize Interruptions: Inform
            those around you of your technique to avoid interruptions. Turn off
            notifications and distractions on your devices. Stick to the Timer:
            Honor the 25-minute work period and the break times strictly. Donâ€™t
            skip breaks, as they are crucial for maintaining sustained focus.
            Track Progress: Keep a log of completed pomodoros to monitor
            productivity and plan future tasks more effectively. Adjust as
            Needed: While 25 minutes is standard, feel free to adjust the length
            of the pomodoros and breaks to better suit your personal rhythm and
            the nature of your tasks.
